Class Map Generator
===================

Class Map Generator is a basic tool for generating Java maps from compiled class names to
short packet names, this is used in CMD-Utils for the packet filter (mcfw.)


Building
========

To build Class Map Generator, run 'make' in this directory and it will build a binary at
'./bin/cmgen'. To get rid of it, run 'make clean'.

You need to have libcurl and libcurlpp installed to build this.


Usage
=====

I would not recommend using this tool as the code is a bit messy and may break if the
Javadoc website (https://maven.fabricmc.net/) updates.

But if you still want to use it, first, build it, then, run
'./bin/cmgen <yarn version>', you can find the latest yarn version on this site:
https://fabricmc.net/develop/ if you scroll down a bit. Running this program may take
up to a few minutes depending on your network speed. The program will generate Java
code for a 'ClassMap' class which can be pasted into 'org.cmdutils.util.ClassMap'
in CMD-Utils.
